Translate the following natural language into valid SMT-LIB2. Output ONLY SMT-LIB2. No markdown, no explanations.

Rules:
- Always output (set-logic <name>) first: use QF_LIA for integer-only, QF_LRA for real-only, QF_LIRA for mixed integers and reals.
- Include (declare-fun ...) for each variable, (assert ...) for constraints, then (check-sat), (exit).
- If the problem asks to minimize or maximize a term, add (minimize x) or (maximize x) (or the expression) before (check-sat).
